# Smart-Accident-Detection-and-Prvention-System-using-Raspberry-pi
The idea of our project is to incorporate the safety measures of seatbelt detection and alcohol detection and alert message using IOT devices in vehicles to significantly reduce the risk of accidents happening.

The first being the detection mechanism. It incorporates the safety measures of seatbelt detection using IR sensors and also tests the alcohol levels in inside the car using Gas detection sensors. It then uses algorithm to test if the alcohol level is below safety limit and then allows the car to advance. Another part of our project focuses on detection of accident. Vibration sensors incorporated in IOT devices inside the car checks for unexpected vibrations and detects accidents. It then proceeds GSM module to mail emergency contacts about the situation, coordinates by GPS module and time. Thus making road driving a lot more secure. 

I also added the false alarm to the system so that if any case we can say that the accident is false by switching ON it. I made the code in order to work faster and first priority is for accident detection .Since the project is wired in the car, our project is secured and the message sending security is depending on the telecommunication. The results of all the sensors are accurate if in the position implemented.

# Proposed Methodology:
### I am using proteus software in this project, which can show the simulation type of the it.
